# Analysis of health conditions across US counties and health outcomes forecasting üìà

In this project we analyzed data from US Census, CDC, and other sources, and build a machine learning model to predict health outcomes across US counties.

The project consists of three main parts, which are:

1. Data collection, preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Machine learning model building 

‚ñ™Ô∏è *Case_Study.ipynb* contains jupyter notebook file with the project itself.

‚ñ™Ô∏è *sunshine_data_scraper.py* contains python code for scraping average annual sunshine data by state (across US).

‚ñ™Ô∏è *requirements.txt* contains all packages you need to install for previous two files to work properly.

‚ñ™Ô∏è *Health_outomes_slides.pdf* is a document with the presentation slides for this project.

‚ö†Ô∏è Some visualizations may not be displayed properly when you open the notebook in Jupyter. So, I reccommend you to open it in Google Colab via following link:
