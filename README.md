# Analysis of health conditions across US counties and health outcomes forecasting 📈

In this project we analyzed data from US Census, CDC, and other sources, and build a machine learning model to predict health outcomes across US counties.

The project consists of three main parts, which are:

1. Data collection, preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Machine learning model building
